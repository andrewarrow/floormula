# about

i was using another app for scanning room dimensions and it wanted me to upgrade
to use it.

so I thought how hard can it be to code this?

You can create a room, then hold the phone against 1 wall, then walk across the room
to another wall, and then you have the width! Then repeat for the length and save
your room. Add the next room and keep going until you have your entire house.

Then you can make a nice floorplan.

All for free and open source.
